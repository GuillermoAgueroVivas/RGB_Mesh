# RGB_Mesh
This is a script for Blender which was made with the purpose of teaching myself how to manipulate data inside of a 3D software.

This script represents my journey through learning how to manipulate an object and a scene 
utilizing python in Blender. The tool itself was a challange to myself in which I decided
I wanted to create a mix of modifiers and get a random result and this one turned out to be an
interesting looking combination.
  
User can change the values of 4 properties related to the 4 modifiers applied after the script
runs and the the operator pop-up comes up. Using F3 and searching 'RGB Mesh' and selecting it 
will allow you to use the properties after this script has ran.

###

Best way to run the script is using the 'Scripting' window in Blender in which you can open the 'RGB_Mesh.py' file, run it and then later go back to the regular
layout and search for 'RGB Mesh' utilizing 'F3' to search within the list of operators.
